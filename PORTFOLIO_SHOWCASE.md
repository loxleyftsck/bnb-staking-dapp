## 💬 **Interview Talking Points**

### "Tell me about a project you're proud of"

**Opening:**
"I built a DeFi staking platform on BNB Smart Chain that demonstrates production-level quality and security practices."

**Details:**

- Implemented APR-based rewards with per-second accrual
- Used OpenZeppelin's security patterns (ReentrancyGuard, AccessControl)
- Achieved 100% test coverage with 37 comprehensive tests
- Created extensive documentation for maintainability

**Results:**

- Grade A+ (92/100) quality rating
- All systems operational and deployable
- Ready for testnet deployment

### "How do you ensure code quality?"

**My Approach:**

1. **Testing First:** 37 tests covering all functions, edge cases, and security
2. **Security Patterns:** OpenZeppelin contracts, access control, reentrancy guards
3. **Documentation:** NatSpec comments, README, security docs
4. **Code Review:** Self-review checklist before considering complete

**Evidence:** 100% test pass rate, comprehensive security features

### "Describe a technical challenge you solved"

**Challenge:** OpenZeppelin v5 changed import paths, breaking compilation

**Solution:**

- Identified security imports moved from `security/` to `utils/`
- Updated all imports systematically
- Verified no breaking changes in functionality
- Documented for future reference

**Learning:** Always check migration guides for major version updates
